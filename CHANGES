0.39
 - Add metadata to Makefile.PL
 - Add Rmpz_bin_si, as suggested by Dana Jacobsen. (Added even though the gmp
   library provides only mpz_bin_ui and mpz_bin_uiui.)
 - Tweaks to Math::GMPz::gmp_v() and Math::GMPz::V::gmp_v()
 - Fix bug in Rruns function.

0.38
 - Alter wrap_gmp_sprintf and wrap_gmp_snprintf to take an extra arg (length of
   buffer to which we write).
 - Remove Rmpz_sprintf_ret and Rmpz_snprintf_ret. (These now seem pointless in
   view of the changes to wrap_gmp_sprintf and wrap_gmp_snprintf.)
 - Add Math::GMPz::__GNU_MP_RELEASE.
 - Alter V.xs to accommodate the possibility that the global constant gmp_version
   has not been set in gmp.h. I've assumed this can only happen if the gmp
   library version is earlier than 4.0.0. (The gmp ChangeLog indicates that this
   is so.)
 - No longer include inttypes.h on the basis of USE_LONG_DOUBLE being defined.
   (Was harmless ... but didn't make much sense.)
 - Define PERL_NO_GET_CONTEXT (in XS code).

0.37
 - Alter test 3i in new.t to allow for the possibility that perl has been bult
   with -Duselongdouble.
 - Remove some of the undocumented (cruddy & irrelevant) functions from GMPz.xs,
   and remove t/supp1.t and t/supp2.t (which tested those functions).
 - Alter the way that strEQ gets hold of HvNAME(SvSTASH(SvRV(sv))) - so that -Wall
   doesn't emit "null argument" warnings. (Thanks Daniel Kahn Gillmor.)

0.36
 - Add Rmpz_2fac_ui, Rmpz_mfac_uiui and Rmpz_primorial_ui (all new in gmp-5.1.0).

0.35
 - Add Math::GMPz::V
 - Add cross-class overloading (with Math::MPFR objects only).

0.34
 - Fix error in Rmpz_gcd_ui. (Should've been returning SV*. Thanks Dana Jacobsen.)
 - Create the NULL mpz_t ($Math::GMPz::NULL)

0.33
 - Remove 'not' from overloads. Apparently achieved nothing anyway, and 5.16
   warns that it's invalid.

0.32
 - Add Rmpz_powm_sec (gmp-5 only, and not available when building against mpir).
 - In the documentation, elaborate on the way that Math::GMPz::get_v() and
   __GNU_MP_VERSION & friends determine their values. (Thanks Vincent Lefevre.)
 - Add Rmpz_div, Rmpz_divmod, Rmpz_div_ui, Rmpz_divmod_ui,
   Rmpz_div_2exp and Rmpz_mod_2exp.

0.31
 - Fix Random.xs so that it compiles with gmp-4 (not just gmp-5).
   Thanks Rob Kuo (https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=58501)

0.29
 - Add proper coverage of random functions
 - Add Rmpz_snprintf and Rmpz_snprintf_ret
 - If there's no variable to be formatted, Rmpz_(f/s)printf no longer
   need to be supplied with a dummy variable.
 - Some buggy tests in printf.t hopefully fixed.

0.28
 Requires gmp-4.2.0 or later.
 In response to bug http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=46499:
 - Amendment to Makefile.PL wrt 'long long' and 'long double' support.
 - Remove reliance on $Config{use64bitint} in t/new.t and t/out_str.t
 - Add some MAC OS X notes to README and fix some typos.

 In response to bug http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=46603
 - In Rmpz_get_d_2exp, change data type of 'exp' from unsigned to signed.

 In response to bug http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=46604
 - Fix ___GMP__CC() and ___GMP_CFLAGS() so that they return undef
   if __GMP_CC and __GMP_CFLAGS are not defined by the gmp library.

 Thanks, Bob Kuo and Jonathan Leto.

0.27
 - Requires gmp-4.2.3 or later
 - Remove (the need for) INLINE.h
 - Change Rmpz_sprintf to return the number of characters written.
 - Change Rmpz_sizeinbase and Rmpz_size to return unsigned longs instead
   of signed long ints.
 - Add __GNU_MP_VERSION, __GNU_MP_VERSION_MINOR, __GNU_MP_VERSION_PATCHLEVEL,
   __GMP_CC and __GMP_CFLAGS
 - Change Rmpz_scan0 and Rmpz_scan1 to return unsigned long. (Returning a
   signed long int was wrong.)
 - Change Rmpz_printf() so that, like its fprintf and sprintf counterparts,
   it formats only one variable at a time.
 - Fix bug in Rmpz_init_set_str (and Rmpz_init_set_str_nobless) that led to
   a segfault if string was invalid (ie if mpz_init_set_str() returned true).

0.26
 - Add Rmpz_fprintf, Rmpz_sprintf and Rmpz_sprintf_ret.
 - Add Rmpz_out_raw and Rmpz_inp_raw.

0.24
 - Add TRmpz_out_str and TRmpz_inp_str.
 - Rmpz_out_str now takes an optional (leading) string argument - a
   string that will be prepended to the mpz_out_str() output.
 - Remove the tests in the Makefile.PL that test for the presence of
   a suitable compiler and GMP library.
 - Remove the "homegrown" primes and supplementary functions from the
   list of exportable functions. (They don't really belong here.) Also
   remove the documentation pertaining to these functions from the POD.
   This is done in preparation for the eventual removal of these
   functions from Math::GMPz. For the time being, however, these
   functions are still available via their fully-qualified names - and
   they're still being tested in the test suite.

0.22
 - Rewrite new()
 - Rmpz_out_str() now takes an optional third argument - a string that
   will be appended to the mpz_out_str() output. Also stdout is
   fflush()'d each time Rmpfr_out_str() is called.
 - The overload functions and new() can now handle a long double value
   correctly

0.21
 - Add "Name" section to the pod
 - Remove 'Makefile.old' from the source. (Doh !!)

0.20
 - First CPAN release
 - No longer assign Exporter and DynaLoader to @Math::GMPz::ISA.
 - Add support for use64bitint
 - add new() function/method to facilitate initialization/assignment
